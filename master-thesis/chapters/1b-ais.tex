The \textit{\acrfull{ais}} is a vessel-to-vessel communication system, which allows vessels to share vital information about their current state.

\section{From individual samples to trajectories}\label{sec:from_ais_to_traj}
\acrshort{ais} samples with identical MMSI and less than $15$ minutes between subsequent samples are considered part of the same trajectory. The $15$ minute requirement is added to make sure samples before and after docking are considered separate trajectories.
