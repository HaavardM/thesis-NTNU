\section{From individual samples to trajectories}\label{sec:from_ais_to_traj}
The raw \acrshort{ais} samples can be converted into trajectory vectors using the following pipeline.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Raw \acrshort{ais} samples are first sorted by timestamp and grouped by MMSI.
    \item Each sample is considered the starting point for a trajectory, and the leading $N$ samples are collected into a vector. $N$ is a fixed number of samples. Samples with fewer than $N$ leading samples are ignored.
\end{enumerate}
