\chapter*{Preface}

I want to thank my supervisors Edmund Førland Brekke and Trym Tengesdal, for all your guidance and especially for allowing me the freedom to focus on the topics I find the most interesting. As a result, I have had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of probabilistic methods and Bayesian Inference. I also want to thank Ravinder Praveen Kumar Jain for your openness and your insight into long-term trajectory prediction.

I want to thank my family for all your support throughout my studies and growing up. The math homework I had to do as a child did pay off eventually. My grandmother, Anne-Marie Mellbye, has also given me tons of support, and I will be forever grateful!   

My partner in crime, Kristine Stray, deserves a tremendous amount of credit. You have patiently listened to me blabbering about statistics and probability theory, and even though I know you are not as amazed as me, you still encourage me to continue! So for this thesis, I especially want to thank you both for helping me keep motivated as well as giving me valuable input. 


This work marks the end of my graduate studies in Cybernetics And Robotics Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. I want to dedicate this thesis to my grandfather, Hans Jørgen Mellbye, who graduated from NTH in 1963 as an electrical engineer. He introduced me to the amazing world of engineering at an early age, which has become a crucial part of who I am today.
