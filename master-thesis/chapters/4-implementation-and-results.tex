\chapter{Implementation And Results}
\section{Statistical Testing}
Inspired by \cite{hexeberg}, we will test the performance of the model for straight-line trajectoires and curved trajectories independently.
\subsection{Straigth-line trajectories}
We use the first $100$ randomly sampled trajectories satisfying the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The sum of subsequent changes in \acrshort{cog} must be less than $30$ degrees, i.e. the trajectory must be close to a straight line.
    \item There must be sufficient data available for training in the neighbourhood around the initial starting point, with similar initial heading and speed.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Prediction Errors}

\subsection{Curved Trajectories}
We use the first $100$ randomly sampled trajectories satisfying the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The sum of subsequent changes in \acrshort{cog} must be greater than $40$ degrees, i.e. the trajectory must be close to a straight line.
    \item There must be sufficient data available for training in the neighbourhood around the initial starting point, with similar initial heading and speed.
\end{enumerate}
