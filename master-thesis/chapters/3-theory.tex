\section{A short recap of necessary probability theory}
The reader is assumed to be already comfortable with basic probability theory. A more detailed introduction has already been covered in a previous specialization project \cite{mellbye}, but some concepts will nevertheless be reintroduced here mainly to specify the mathematical notation used throughout this thesis. 

\subsection{Probability Distributions}
The notation $p(X)$ is used to denote the probability distribution of the random variable $X$, regardless of $X$ being discrete or random. Whether $p(X)$ refers to the \textit{\acrfull{pdf}} for continuous random variables or \textit{\acrfull{pmf}} for discrete random variables therefore depends on the context. For the probability of a specific event occurring, the notation $\Pr\{X=x\}$ and $\Pr\{X \leq x\}$ will be used instead. The result is always a real number, i.e. $\Pr\{\cdot\} \in (0, 1)$. 

\subsection{Joint Distribution}
The notation $p(X, Y) = p(X \cap Y)$ is used to denote the joint probability of $X$ and $Y$. It is the probability of both events occurring at once.

\subsection{Conditional Distribution}
The notation $X | Y$ is used to express the event $X$ occurring given the known event occurrence $Y$. In the context of probability distributions, $p(X | Y)$ denotes the probability of $X$ occurring, given that the event $Y$ has already occurred. It is perhaps easier to read as ``the current belief about a quantity $X$ given a known value of $Y$'', as $Y$ will in this thesis usually be some parameter rather than a discrete event. 

As this thesis will use a Bayesian interpretation of probability, the notation may also be used to express the parameters of a distribution, for instance $\mathcal{N}(x \; | \;\mu, \sigma^2)$ is the \acrshort{pdf}  for the Gaussian distribution $x$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$.

\subsection{Marginal Distribution}
The integral notation will be used to denote the marginal distribution for both discrete and continuous random variables. For discrete variables, the integral is implicitly replaced by a sum.  

\begin{equation}
    p(X) = \int_{\boldsymbol{Y}} p(X \cap \boldsymbol{Y}) d\boldsymbol{Y} = \int_{\boldsymbol{Y}} p(X | \boldsymbol{Y}) p(\boldsymbol{Y}) d\boldsymbol{Y}
\end{equation}

The last equality is commonly referred to as \textit{The Law of total probability} and allows a complex distribution $p(X)$ to be expressed in several simpler components.

\subsection{The Law of Iterated Expectations \& Conditional Variance}

The \textit{Law of Iterated Expecations} states that 
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}[X] = \mathbb{E} \big[ \mathbb{E}[ X | Y] \big]
\end{equation} if all the expectations exists. Similarily, the \textit{Law of Total Variance} states that 
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}\big[\mathbb{V}[X | Y]\big] + \mathbb{V}\big[ \mathbb{E}[X | Y] \big]
\end{equation}

These results are useful when computing the expected value and variance of complex distributions, as they allow the computations to be separated into simpler, conditional computations. Proofs are available in \cite{aronow_miller_2019}.

\subsection{Central Limit Theorem}\label{sec:clt}
The \textit{central limit theorem} should be familiar to most readers, and it is essential to the derivations in a later chapter. Consider a set of \textit{\acrfull{iid}} random variables $X_i$ following any distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. The sum of these variables 
\begin{equation}
    S_N = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} X_i
\end{equation} 
can be shown to approach the Gaussian distribution
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{N \to \infty} p(S_N=s) = \mathcal{N}(s \; | \; N \mu, N\sigma^2)
\end{equation}
as N increases, even if the original variables are not Gaussian distributed \cite{murphy}. For a finite $N$ it can be used to approximate the sum of \acrshort{iid} random variables as a Gaussian distribution.

\subsection{Interpretation of Probability}
This thesis will heavily rely on a Bayesian interpretation of probability. Bayesian Statistics is extensively covered in the specialization project \cite{mellbye}, and only a short introduction is included here. Without going into unnecessary philosophical details, the Bayesian view interprets probabilities as beliefs rather than relative frequencies\footnote{The interpretation of probabilities as the relative frequency of outcomes from repeated trials is what is often taught in statistics courses and is called the \textit{frequentist} interpretation.}. 
The benefit of the Bayesian interpretation is that it can naturally be used to model uncertainty of events that cannot easily be expressed as repeated trials. Examples include one-off events and parameter estimation of fixed but unknown quantities.\footnote{As a thought experiment, let us say you want to determine the number of trees on the planet. There is a fixed amount of trees, but the actual number is unknown as you cannot count every single one. There is nothing uncertain about the number of trees itself, only about your beliefs, which are uncertain due to incomplete knowledge.} \cite{murphy}.

Central to the Basian view of probability is \textit{Bayes rule}, which is used to update the prior beliefs $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ when observing new data $\mathcal{D}$. Bayes rule is given by \cref{eq:bayes} where $p(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the prior belief about $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ before observing $\mathcal{D}$, $p(\mathcal{D} | \boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the likelihood of observing $\mathcal{D}$ given a known value for $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, $p(\mathcal{D})$ is a normalization constant and $p(\boldsymbol{\theta} | \mathcal{D})$ is the \textit{posterior} beliefs about $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ after observing $\mathcal{D}$. 
\begin{tcolorbox}[ams equation, title={Bayes Rule}]\label{eq:bayes}
    p(\boldsymbol{\theta} | \mathcal{D}) = \frac{p(\boldsymbol{\theta} \cap \mathcal{D})}{p(\mathcal{D})} = \frac{p(\mathcal{D} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) p(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{p(\mathcal{D})}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution}
The Gaussian Distribution is one of the most used distributions in statistics \cite{murphy} and generalizes well for multivariate variables. The pdf for the $D$Â dimensional multivariate Gaussian is given by \cref{eq:multivariate_gaussian} \cite{murphy,rasmussen}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:multivariate_gaussian}
    \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{x} \; | \; \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}) \triangleq \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{D/2} |\boldsymbol{\Sigma} | ^{1/2}} \exp \bigg[- \frac{1}{2} (\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})^\intercal \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})\bigg]
\end{equation}
\subsection{Marginalization and conditioning}
Consider the joint multivariate Gaussian distribution for two (potentially vector-valued) variables $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$. 
\begin{equation}
    p(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}) = \mathcal{N}\bigg(\begin{bmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{x} \\ \boldsymbol{y}
    \end{bmatrix} \; \bigg| \; \begin{bmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{\mu}_x \\ \boldsymbol{\mu}_y
    \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{\Sigma_{xx}} &
        \boldsymbol{\Sigma_{xy}} \\
        \boldsymbol{\Sigma_{yx}} &
        \boldsymbol{\Sigma_{yy}}
    \end{bmatrix}\bigg)
\end{equation}
The marginal and posterior conditional distribution are given by \cref{eq:multivariate_gaussian_marginal} and \cref{eq:multivariate_gaussian_conditional} respectively \cite{rasmussen}, and will be used extensively throughout this thesis.
Note that the marginal distribution does not actually require any calculations and is found by selecting the corresponding values from $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$. 
\begin{tcolorbox}[ams align, title={Marginal Distribution}]\label{eq:multivariate_gaussian_marginal}
    p(\boldsymbol{x}) = \int_{\boldsymbol{y}} p(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}) d\boldsymbol{y} = \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{x} \; | \; \boldsymbol{\mu}_x, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xx})
\end{tcolorbox}

 \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Posterior Conditional Distribution}]
 \begin{subequations}\label{eq:multivariate_gaussian_conditional}
 \begin{align}
    p(\boldsymbol{x} | \boldsymbol{y}) &= \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{x} \; | \; \boldsymbol{\mu}_{x|y}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{x|y})\\
    \boldsymbol{\mu}_{x|y} &= \boldsymbol{\mu}_x + \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xy}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{yy}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{y} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_y)\\
    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{x|y} &= \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xx} -\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xy}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{yy}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{yx}
 \end{align}
 \end{subequations}
 \end{tcolorbox}


\section{Introduction to Gaussian Processes}\label{sec:gp}

This introduction is heavily inspired by \cite{rasmussen}, where more details can be found for those interested. This introduction will only consider the scalar case, and the discussion of vector-valued functions is delayed until \cref{sec:theory_vector_gp}. Rest assured, this introduction easily extends to vector-valued functions!

A \acrfull{gp} can formally be defined as Definition \ref{def:gp}.

\newtheorem{gp_def}{Definition}
\begin{gp_def}\label{def:gp}
A Gaussian Process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which has a joint Gaussian Distribution.
\end{gp_def}

In this thesis, a more specific definition is adopted in order to interpret \acrshort{gp}s as a statistical distribution over functions. A \acrshort{gp} for a random function $f \triangleq f(\boldsymbol{x})$ is fully specified by its mean function $m(\boldsymbol{x})$ and covariance function $k(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}')$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:gp}
    f \sim GP(\;m(\boldsymbol{x}), \; k(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}')\;)
\end{equation}

This interpretation of a \acrshort{gp} might seem a bit odd at first. It may help to think of functions as infinitely long vectors containing the function values for all possible inputs. The key observation is that the marginal distribution $p(\boldsymbol{x})$ of a multivariate Gaussian distribution $p(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y})$ is another Gaussian distribution that is completely independent of $\boldsymbol{y}$, as expressed in \cref{eq:multivariate_gaussian_marginal}. Any variables not of interest can therefore be easily marginalized away. Any \acrshort{gp} by Definition \ref{def:gp} can therefore be viewed as the finite marginal distribution of an infinite Gaussian Distribution, jointly describing the values of $f$ at all possible inputs $\boldsymbol{x}$. In the end, a \acrshort{gp} is nothing more than a joint Gaussian Distribution with a fancy interpretation.

\subsection{A quick note on vector notation}
Different notations for vector values are used to differentiate between three common cases:
\begin{description}
\item[Bold letters] are used to indicate a single, multivariate value. $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ is the scalar function $f$ evaluated at the multivariate input $\boldsymbol{x}$. In practice, this implies that the input is a column vector $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathcal{R}^{M}$ with $M \geq 2$ elements. 
\item[Capital letters] such as $X$, are used to indicate multiple (potentially multivariate) samples. $f(X)$ is the scalar function $f$ evaluated at each row in $X$. In practice this implies that the input $X \in \mathcal{R}^{N x M}$ with $N \geq 2$ rows (samples) and $M \geq 1$ columns (dimensions).
\item[Vector Arrows] such as $\vec{f}$ are used to denote vector-fields (i.e. vector-valued functions). This will be useful for vector-valued \acrshort{gp}s as it allows the distinction between shorthand notations such as $\boldsymbol{f}_* = f(X_*)$, $\vec{f}_* = \vec{f}(\boldsymbol{x}_*)$ and $\vec{\boldsymbol{f}}_* = \vec{f}(X_*)$.
\end{description}

\subsection{Introduction to kernels}
The covariance function $k(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}')$ determines the similarity between two different points $\boldsymbol{x}$Â and $\boldsymbol{x}'$. These covariance functions will be referred to as \textit{kernels}, which maps the input space to a \textit{feature-space} \cite{rasmussen}. The output of the kernel is a value describing the similarity (i.e., covariance) between the two inputs. Kernel functions are discussed in greater detail in \cref{sec:kernels}.

The kernel must be positive definite to produce a valid covariance matrix, which requires that

\begin{equation}
    k(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}') = k(\boldsymbol{x}', \boldsymbol{x})
\end{equation}

The covariance matrix $K(X, X)$ is the result of calling $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ on all pairs of inputs, i.e.
\begin{equation} 
    K(X, X)_{ij} = k(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j) \quad \forall i, j
\end{equation}

\subsection{Conditioning}
So far, only the prior distribution for $f$ has been specified. As a \acrshort{gp} is by definition a multivariate Gaussian Distribution, the posterior conditional in \cref{eq:multivariate_gaussian_conditional} can be used to condition $f$ on observed values. A simple \acrshort{gp} $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ with mean $m(\boldsymbol{x})$Â and kernel $k(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}')$ will be used as an example on conditional \acrshort{gp}s.

Let $\boldsymbol{f}_* \triangleq f(X_*)$ denote the function evaluated at test points $X_*$. The prior distribution over $\boldsymbol{f_*}$ is shown in \cref{fig:gp_prior}. From a Bayesian perspective, the goal is to update the prior beliefs about $\boldsymbol{f}_*$ using the (potentially) noisy observations $\boldsymbol{y} = f(X) + \epsilon$ at multiple inputs $X$ to get the posterior belief $p(\boldsymbol{f}_* \; | X, \boldsymbol{y}, X_*)$. The noise term $\epsilon$ is considered \acrshort{iid} and distributed according to $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

The joint distribution of $\boldsymbol{y}$Â and $\boldsymbol{f}_*$ is given by 

\begin{equation}
    p(\boldsymbol{y}, \boldsymbol{f}_*) = \mathcal{N}\bigg(\begin{bmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{y} \\ \boldsymbol{f}_*
    \end{bmatrix} \; \bigg| \begin{bmatrix}
        m(X) \\ m(X_*)
    \end{bmatrix},  \begin{bmatrix}
        K(X, X) + \sigma^2 I & K(X, X_*) \\ K(X_*, X) & K(X_*, X_*)
    \end{bmatrix}\bigg)
\end{equation}
and the posterior distribution $p(\boldsymbol{f}_* | \boldsymbol{y})$ is computed using the posterior conditional distribution in \cref{eq:multivariate_gaussian_conditional}.
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:gp_conditional}
\begin{align}
    p(\boldsymbol{f}_* | \boldsymbol{y}) &= \mathcal{N}(f \; | \; \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\boldsymbol{f}_*|\boldsymbol{y}}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\boldsymbol{f}_*|\boldsymbol{y}})\\
    \mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{f}_*] =  \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\boldsymbol{f}_* | \boldsymbol{y}} &= m(X_*) + K(X_*, X) \; \big(K(X, X) + \sigma^2 I\big)^{-1} \; (\boldsymbol{y} - m(X))\label{eq:gp_conditional_mean}\\
    \mathbb{V}[\boldsymbol{f}_*] = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\boldsymbol{f}_* | \boldsymbol{y}} &= K(X_*, X_*) - K(X_*, X)  \big(K(X, X) + \sigma^2 I\big)^{-1} \; K(X, X_*)\label{eq:gp_conditional_var}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

As the notation quickly gets messy for the general case, the shorthand notation for evaluating $f(\boldsymbol{x}_*)$ at a single test point is introduced as well. To follow the convention used by \cite{rasmussen}, $\boldsymbol{k}_* \triangleq K(X, \boldsymbol{x}_*)$ is used to denote the vector of covariances calculated between the test point and each of the training samples. The notation $K \triangleq K(X, X)$, $\bar{f}_* \triangleq \mathbb{E}[f_*]$, and $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (K + \sigma^2 I)^{-1} \big(\boldsymbol{y} - m(X)\big)$ is also added to simplify the equations. Using this shorthand notation for a single test case, \cref{eq:gp_conditional} boils down to \cref{eq:gp_conditional_simple}.

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:gp_conditional_simple}
\begin{align}
    \bar{f}_* = \mathbb{E}[f_*]  &= m(\boldsymbol{x}_*) + \boldsymbol{k}_*^\intercal ( K + \sigma^2 I)^{-1} (\boldsymbol{y} - m(X))\label{eq:gp_conditional_mean_simple}\\
     &= m(\boldsymbol{x}_*) + \boldsymbol{k}_*^\intercal \boldsymbol{\alpha}\\
    \mathbb{V}[f_*] &= k(\boldsymbol{x}_*, \boldsymbol{x}_*) - \boldsymbol{k}_*^\intercal K^{-1} \; \boldsymbol{k}_*\label{eq:gp_conditional_var_simple}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

In practice, computing the inverse $K(X, X)$ becomes expensive for an increasing number of samples. To avoid numerical instability, using the \textit{Cholesky Decomposition} is usually preferred. The Cholesky Decomposition forms a new lower-triangular matrix $L$ such that $K = L L^\intercal$, assuming $K$ is symmetric and positive definite, and it is considered extremely numerically stable \cite{rasmussen}. \cref{eq:gp_conditional} can then be computed using $L$. The diagonal entry $\sigma^2 I$ added to the kernel matrix is intended to model noisy observations, while in practice it also improves the numerical stability. A small value is therefore recommended even if the observations are noise-free \cite{scikit-learn}.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
    \mathbb{E}[{\boldsymbol{f}}_*] &= m(X_*) + K(X_*, X) \; (L L^\intercal)^{-1} \; (\boldsymbol{y} - m(X))\\ &= m(X_*) + K(X_*, X) \; \underbrace{\big[(L^\intercal)^{-1} (L)^{-1}  \; (\boldsymbol{y} - m(X))\big]}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}
    \end{split}\\
    \begin{split}
    \mathbb{V}[\boldsymbol{f}_*] &= K(X_*, X_*) - K(X_*, X) \; (L L^\intercal)^{-1} \; K(X, X_*)\\
    &= K(X_*, X_*) - K(X_*, X) \; (L^\intercal)^{-1} (L)^{-1} \; K(X, X_*)\\
    &= K(X_*, X_*) - \underbrace{\big[(L)^{-1} \; K(X, X_*)\big]^\intercal}_{\boldsymbol{v^\intercal}} \; \underbrace{\big[(L)^{-1} \; K(X, X_*)\big]}_{\boldsymbol{v}}
    \end{split}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

The whole procedure boils down to \cref{alg:gp_prediction} as proposed by \cite{rasmussen}. A simple \acrshort{gp} before and after conditioning is shown in \cref{fig:gp_simple}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

    \State $\mathbb{V}[\boldsymbol{f}_*] = K(X_*, X_*) - \boldsymbol{v}^\intercal \boldsymbol{v}$
    \State \Return $\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{f}_*], \; \mathbb{V}[\boldsymbol{f}_*]$

\end{figure}

\section{Vector-valued Gaussian Process}\label{sec:theory_vector_gp}
\acrshort{gp}s can easily be extended for vector-valued functions by simply considering the joint distribution of each function component as in \cref{eq:gp_vector}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gp_vector}
     \vec{f}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \begin{bmatrix} f_x (\boldsymbol{x})\\ f_y (\boldsymbol{x})\end{bmatrix} \sim \text{GP} \big(\begin{bmatrix} m_x(\boldsymbol{x})\\m_y(\boldsymbol{x})\end{bmatrix}, \ \begin{bmatrix}
    k_{xx}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}') & k_{xy}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}') \\ k_{xy}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}')^\intercal & k_{yy}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}')
    \end{bmatrix}\big) 
\end{equation}

Only independent output dimensions, i.e. $k_xy = k_yx = 0$ will be considered in this thesis to reduce the number of complicating factors. This is, however, not without consequences as it assumes zero covariance between the two outputs. This issue is revisited in \cref{chap:discussion}.

\section{Kernels}\label{sec:kernels}
This section will introduce some relevant kernels for this thesis. Many more kernels are available in the literature \cite{rasmussen}.  
\subsection{Stationary Kernels}
Stationary kernels are kernels which only depends on $\boldsymbol{r} = \boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{x'}$ and is usually specified as a function of a single variable.
\subsubsection{Constant Kernel}
As the name implies, the constant kernel is a kernel that is independent of the input. It is typically used as a scaling parameter in combination with other kernels.

\begin{equation}
    k(\boldsymbol{\cdot}) = \sigma^2
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{White kernel}
The \textit{White Kernel} is useful for modeling whitenoise in a system as \acrshort{iid} \cite{scikit-learn}. The white kernel is given by
\begin{equation}
    k(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j) = \delta_{ij} \sigma^2
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker-delta which is $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ otherwise. This is the same as the noise term added in \cref{alg:gp_prediction}.

\subsubsection{Radial Basis Function}\label{sec:kernels_rbf}
The \textit{\acrfull{rbf}} kernel, also referred to as \textit{squared exponential kernel}, is one of the most frequently used kernels, and is given by the covariance function in \cref{sec:kernels_rbf}. The scaling parameter $l$ is the \textit{charactheristic length scale} and can intuitively be thought of as a smoothness parameter. This kernel yields infinitely differentiable functions, meaning that any function drawn from a \acrshort{gp} with this kernel is very smooth\cite{rasmussen}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kernel_rbf}
    k(\boldsymbol{r}) = \exp \big\{-\frac{||\boldsymbol{r}||^2}{2 l^2}\big\}
\end{equation} 

\subsubsection{MatÃ©rn class}
The \textit{MatÃ©rn Class} of kernels is given by the covariance function in \cref{eq:kernel_matern}, where $K_v$ is the \textit{modified Bessel function}. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:kernel_matern}
    k(\boldsymbol{r}) = \frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)}\bigg(\frac{\sqrt{2 \nu} ||\boldsymbol{r}||}{l} \bigg)^\nu K_\nu \bigg(\frac{\sqrt{2\nu} || \boldsymbol{r}||}{l} \bigg)
\end{equation}
The parameter $\nu > 0$ determines the smoothness, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\nu=\frac{1}{2}$ yields the \textit{Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process} and functions, that when drawn from a \acrshort{gp}, are continious, but not differentiable. The kernel is equivalent to $$k(\boldsymbol{r}) = \exp \big\{-\frac{||\boldsymbol{r}||}{l}\big\}$$
    \item $\nu=\frac{3}{2}$ yields functions that, when drawn from a \acrshort{gp}, are continous and once-differentiable. The kernel is equivalent to $$k(\boldsymbol{r}) = \big(1 + \frac{\sqrt{3} ||\boldsymbol{r}||}{l}\big) \exp\big\{- \frac{\sqrt{3} ||\boldsymbol{r}||}{l}\big\}$$
    \item $\nu=\frac{5}{2}$ yields functions, that when drawn from a \acrshort{gp},  are continous and twice differentiable. The kernel is equivalent to $$k(\boldsymbol{r}) = \big(1 + \frac{\sqrt{5} ||\boldsymbol{r}||}{l} + \frac{5 ||\boldsymbol{r}||^2}{3 l^2}\big) \exp\big\{- \frac{\sqrt{5} ||\boldsymbol{r}||}{l}\big\}$$
\end{itemize}
More generally, the functions drawn from a \acrshort{gp} with a MatÃ©rn class kernel, is $k$-times differentiable if and only if $\nu > k$\cite{rasmussen}. The MatÃ©rn class of kernels is argued to be a better choice than the \acrshort{rbf} kernel for many physical systems, as the infinitely smooth function generated by \acrshort{rbf} is too smooth \cite{rasmussen}.
Further mathematical details can be found in \cite[sec.~4.2]{rasmussen} as it is outside the scope of this thesis.


\subsection{Combining multiple kernels}
Kernels can be mixed and matched through multiplication and addition, where the behavior of the individual kernels can be combined to describe more complex functions. A simple example is using the constant kernel to scale the covariance of other kernels. Different kernels can also be used for each input dimension.
\section{Hyperparameter selection}
Manually tuning the kernel hyperparameters is tedious and time-consuming, motivating the need for automatic selection of parameters. This section will discuss an automated approach for hyperparameter selection with \acrshort{gp}s.

\subsection{Maximum Likelihood - The Marginal Likelihood}\label{sec:gp_mle}
The \textit{marginal likelihood}, which is the likelihood of observing a set of given observations $\boldsymbol{y}$, conditioned on a \acrshort{gp} with kernel parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ and inputs $X$, is given by 

\begin{equation}
    p(\boldsymbol{y} \; | \; X, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathcal{N}\big(\boldsymbol{y} \; | \; \boldsymbol{m}(X), K_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(X, X)\big)
\end{equation}
and can be used to obtain a \textit{\acrfull{ml}} estimate of the parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.
Defining $\tilde{\boldsymbol{y}} \triangleq \boldsymbol{y} - \boldsymbol{m}(X)$ and taking the logarithm yields \cref{eq:gp_log_marginal_likelihood} 
\begin{tcolorbox}[ams align, title={Log Marginal Likelihood}]\label{eq:gp_log_marginal_likelihood}
    \begin{split}
    \log p(\boldsymbol{y} \; | \; X, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = &-\frac{1}{2} \tilde{\boldsymbol{y}}^\intercal K_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(X, X)^{-1}\tilde{\boldsymbol{y}} - \frac{1}{2} \log |K_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(X, X)| \ldots\\ &- \frac{n}{2} \log (2 \pi)
    \end{split}
\end{tcolorbox} where the optimal hyperparameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{ML}}$ can be found by maximizing this quantity\footnote{
    The marginal likelihood is generally not a convex function of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ as the kernel functions are usually non-linear functions of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, and multiple local optima may exist. The practical effects include that the observed data may be explained well by different combinations of parameters, and each combination serves as a distinct interpretation of the data. During optimization, care should be taken to avoid a bad local optimum \cite{rasmussen}.}, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{ML}} = \arg \max_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \log p(\boldsymbol{y} \; | \; X, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \arg \min_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \big(- \log p(\boldsymbol{y} \; | \; X, \boldsymbol{\theta})\big)
\end{equation}

The name marginal likelihood comes from the fact that the latent function $\boldsymbol{f}$ is marginalized out, i.e. the parameters are optimized over all possible latent functions $\boldsymbol{f}$.

\begin{equation}
    p(\boldsymbol{y} \; | \; X, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \int_{\boldsymbol{f}} p\big(\boldsymbol{y} \;| \; \boldsymbol{f}\big) p\big(\boldsymbol{f} \; |\; m(X), K(X, X)\big) d\boldsymbol{f}
\end{equation}

The marginal likelihood is somewhat resilient to overfitting, as it naturally incorporates a trade-off between model complexity and model fit. However, the optimization step always imposes the risk of overfitting, especially if there are many hyperparameters \cite{rasmussen}. 

Optimizing \cref{eq:gp_log_marginal_likelihood} with gradient descent requires the inversion of the kernel matrix at each iteration. It quickly becomes a costly operation, limiting the size of the dataset that can be used realistically. A possible solution to this problem is to approximate the global \acrshort{gp} by several local models, as proposed in work such as \cite{paralell_gp_mle,paralell_gp_mle_2}. These smaller \acrshort{gp} models can then be evaluated in parallel and collaborate in the search for a global optimum. 

\section{Sampling from a Gaussian Process}\label{sec:gp_samples}
As the \acrshort{gp} is a joint Gaussian distribution, random samples can be drawn from it as with any other multivariate Gaussian.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:gp_samples}
    \boldsymbol{f}_* \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}_*, \mathbb{V}[\boldsymbol{f}_*])
\end{equation}

More specifically, a vector of \acrshort{iid} standard normal samples, $Z$, can be turned into samples from a joint Gaussian distribution.

Once again, the Cholesky decomposition is used to decompose the \acrshort{gp} covariance, i.e. $\mathbb{V}[\boldsymbol{f}_*] = L L^\intercal$. Using $L$ and $\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}_*$, \cref{eq:gp_samples} can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{N}(\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}_*, \mathbb{V}[\boldsymbol{f}_*]) = \bar{\boldsymbol{f}}_* + L \mathcal{N}(0, I)
\end{equation}
which yields a way to convert indendent standard normal samples into samples from a \acrshort{gp} \cite{rasmussen}:

\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{f}_* = \bar{\boldsymbol{f}}_* + L Z, \quad Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
\end{equation}

\section{Standardization}
The method of \textit{standardization} is the process of converting the data into a standard unit of measurement, which in practice typically involves transforming the data to have zero mean and unit variance \cite{isl}. This is useful when comparing measures of different scales.

The proposed \acrshort{gp} implementation works well with and without standardized input data, but standardization has one crucial benefit. While the current implementation allows separate kernel hyperparameters for each input dimension in $\boldsymbol{x}$, the kernel is assumed to be identical for each output of $\vec{f}$. The kernel therefore represents the variability of \textbf{both} output dimensions at once. However, with standardized training outputs $Y$, the kernel is relative to the standard deviation of the training data. This way, the \acrshort{gp} can express the different levels of uncertainty for each output dimension while still sharing the same kernel. An even more flexible approach would be to allow separate kernels for each dimension, though at the cost of more complex hyperparameter tuning.

\section{Approximate methods}
The standard derivation of the \acrshort{gp} requires inverting the kernel matrix, either through the Cholesky Decomposition or directly. Unfortunately, the computational complexity is $\frac{n^3}{6}$ operations for the Cholesky Decomposition and similarly $\frac{n^2}{2}$ for solving triangular systems \cite{rasmussen}. This may be acceptable for sparse datasets, but it makes \acrshort{gp}s infeasible for Big Data applications. 

For simple functions, it often works well to only use a representable subset of the data. However, throwing away the majority of available data is not an elegant solution to the problem. 

\subsection{Reduced-rank approximation}

Several approximations are discussed in \cite{rasmussen} and typically use a \textit{reduced-rank approximation} of the kernel matrix $K=Q Q^\intercal$ with $Q \in \mathcal{R}^{n \times q}$, and use the \textit{matrix inversion lemma} \cite[p.~201]{rasmussen}, reducing the inversion of the $n \times n$ matrix to the inversion of a $q \times q$ matrix instead. Unfortunately, the optimal reduced-rank approximations depend on the eigenvalue decomposition, which itself is a $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ operation. However, if a cheap approximation to the eigenvalue decomposition can be found, it can potentially be used to approximate the \acrshort{gp}. One such low-rank approximation is the NystrÃ¶m method, where a subset of the dataset is used to approximate the eigenvalues.    

\subsection{Sparse Variational Gaussian Process}

To deal with the computational complexity of \acrshort{gp}s, \cite{Titsias2008VariationalMS} introduced the \textit{\acrfull{svgp}}. Rather than directly using all the available training data directly, one can instead attempt to summarize the data $(X, \boldsymbol{y})$ using a set of $m$ \textit{inducing variables} for the latent function values $\boldsymbol{f}_m$ at the inducing points $X_m$. $X_m$ can either be a subset of the available training inputs $X$ or auxiliary \textit{pseudo-points}. The goal of \acrshort{svgp} is then to infer the inducing points $X_m$ as well as the hyperparameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ from data.
