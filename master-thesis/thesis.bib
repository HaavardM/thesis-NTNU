  abstract  = {Existing trajectory clustering algorithms group similar trajectories as a whole, thus discovering common trajectories. Our key observation is that clustering trajectories as a whole could miss common sub-trajectories. Discovering common sub-trajectories is very useful in many applications, especially if we have regions of special interest for analysis. In this paper, we propose a new partition-and-group framework for clustering trajectories, which partitions a trajectory into a set of line segments, and then, groups similar line segments together into a cluster. The primary advantage of this framework is to discover common sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-group framework, we develop a trajectory clustering algorithm TRACLUS. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and grouping. For the first phase, we present a formal trajectory partitioning algorithm using the minimum description length(MDL) principle. For the second phase, we present a density-based line-segment clustering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACLUS correctly discovers common sub-trajectories from real trajectory data.},

  abstract = {The uncertainty of ship trajectory prediction is addressed. In particular, a probabilistic trajectory prediction model is proposed that describes the uncertainty in future positions along the ship trajectories by continuous probability distributions. The ship motion prediction is decomposed into lateral and longitudinal directions, and position probabilities are calculated along these two directions. A data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model based on a Gaussian Process is proposed to describe the lateral motion uncertainty, while the longitudinal uncertainty results from the uncertainty on the ship acceleration along the route. The parameters of the probabilistic models are derived off-line based on historic trajectory information provided by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The model is then applied to predict the trajectory uncertainty in real time by iteratively updating the prior probability models based on new observed AIS data. Moreover, a sequential Cholesky decomposition algorithm is applied in this study to reduce the computational effort required by the Gaussian Process modelling. Three months of AIS data are used to train and test the proposed probabilistic trajectory prediction model. The results obtained show that the proposed method has high prediction accuracy and meets the demands of real-time applications.}

Using an input-dependent adaptation of the Dirichlet Process, we implement a gating network for an infinite number of Experts. Inference in this model may be done efficiently using a Markov Chain relying on Gibbs sampling. The model allows the effective covariance function to vary with the inputs, and may handle large datasets – thus potentially overcoming two of the biggest hurdles with GP models. Simulations show the viability of this approach.},

  abstract = {Drug development commonly studies an adult population first and then the pediatric population. The knowledge from the adult population is taken advantage of for the design of the pediatric trials. Adjusted drug doses for these are often derived from adult pharmacokinetic (PK) models which are extrapolated to patients with smaller body size. This extrapolation is based on scaling physiologic model parameters with a body size measure accounting for organ size differences. The inherent assumption is that children are merely small adults. However, children can be subject to additional effects such as organ maturation. These effects are not present in the adult population and are possibly overlooked at the design stage of the pediatric trials. It is thus crucial to qualify the extrapolation assumptions once the pediatric trial data are available. In this work, we propose a model based on a non-parametric regression method called Gaussian process (GP) to detect deviations from the made extrapolation assumptions. We introduce the theoretical background of this model and compare its performance to a parametric expansion of the adult model. The comparison includes simulations and a clinical study data example. The results show that the GP approach can reliably detect maturation trends from sparse pediatric data.},

  abstract = {One popular approach to likelihood-free inference is the synthetic likelihood method, which assumes that some data summary statistics which are informative about model parameters are approximately Gaussian for each value of the parameter. Based on this assumption, a Gaussian likelihood can be constructed, where the mean and covariance matrix of the summary statistics are estimated via Monte Carlo. The objective of the current work is to improve on a variational implementation of the Bayesian synthetic likelihood introduced recently in the literature, to enable the application of that approach to high-dimensional problems. Here high-dimensional can mean problems with more than one hundred parameters. The improvements introduced relate to shrinkage estimation of covariance matrices in estimation of the synthetic likelihood, improved implementation of control variate approaches to stochastic gradient variance reduction, and parsimonious but expressive parametrizations of variational normal posterior covariance matrices in terms of factor structures to reduce the dimension of the optimization problem. The shrinkage covariance estimation is particularly important for stability of stochastic gradient optimization with noisy likelihood estimates. However, as the dimension increases, the quality of the posterior approximation deteriorates unless the number of Monte Carlo samples used to estimate the synthetic likelihood also increases. We explore the properties of the method in some real examples in cases where either the number of summary statistics, the number of model parameters, or both, are large.}
