  abstract  = {Existing trajectory clustering algorithms group similar trajectories as a whole, thus discovering common trajectories. Our key observation is that clustering trajectories as a whole could miss common sub-trajectories. Discovering common sub-trajectories is very useful in many applications, especially if we have regions of special interest for analysis. In this paper, we propose a new partition-and-group framework for clustering trajectories, which partitions a trajectory into a set of line segments, and then, groups similar line segments together into a cluster. The primary advantage of this framework is to discover common sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-group framework, we develop a trajectory clustering algorithm TRACLUS. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and grouping. For the first phase, we present a formal trajectory partitioning algorithm using the minimum description length(MDL) principle. For the second phase, we present a density-based line-segment clustering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACLUS correctly discovers common sub-trajectories from real trajectory data.},

  abstract = {The uncertainty of ship trajectory prediction is addressed. In particular, a probabilistic trajectory prediction model is proposed that describes the uncertainty in future positions along the ship trajectories by continuous probability distributions. The ship motion prediction is decomposed into lateral and longitudinal directions, and position probabilities are calculated along these two directions. A data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model based on a Gaussian Process is proposed to describe the lateral motion uncertainty, while the longitudinal uncertainty results from the uncertainty on the ship acceleration along the route. The parameters of the probabilistic models are derived off-line based on historic trajectory information provided by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The model is then applied to predict the trajectory uncertainty in real time by iteratively updating the prior probability models based on new observed AIS data. Moreover, a sequential Cholesky decomposition algorithm is applied in this study to reduce the computational effort required by the Gaussian Process modelling. Three months of AIS data are used to train and test the proposed probabilistic trajectory prediction model. The results obtained show that the proposed method has high prediction accuracy and meets the demands of real-time applications.}

Using an input-dependent adaptation of the Dirichlet Process, we implement a gating network for an infinite number of Experts. Inference in this model may be done efficiently using a Markov Chain relying on Gibbs sampling. The model allows the effective covariance function to vary with the inputs, and may handle large datasets – thus potentially overcoming two of the biggest hurdles with GP models. Simulations show the viability of this approach.},
